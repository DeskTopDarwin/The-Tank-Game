The Tank Game

Description:
A Game where you play as a tank and capture points to win.
You will have to fight enemy AI and you will be assisted by friendly AI.
Beware of friendly fire.

Controls:
WASD to move;
Mouse to aim;
Left mouse click to shoot main cannon;
Spacebar to fire machine gun;
Hold left ALT key to move cursor on screen;

In Detail:
Both team start with 2000 tickets, if your team has more capture points
than the enemy team has, you will start bleeding off tickets of the enemy
team and vise versa. Capture points owned by your team will resupply your
tank by going over it. AI will capture points as main focus but will
attack enemies within range.
Capture Points with both team present on it will enter conflict and will
go back to neutral if point wasn't capture prior.

Known issues:
-Currently player is immoratal as AT units are yet to be added. WIP
-Units that dies on capture points still count as present on the point.
 This causes points to be forever in conflict mode.
-Turret behaves weird when the tank rolls.
-AI will move very slowly further in the game progress. 
-No sound yet. WIP
-No Visual effects. WIP
-No visual reference to witch point is captured by witch team. WIP
